# Red Hot Beans 🌶️

Entry for kajam 2022, Red Hot Beans - These beans are red and hot and you'll have to milk them down!

I'm honestly not totally happy with how this game turned out, but i'm just, yknon trying to not feel so bad about it? Maybe jams aren't my thing, i'll still be participating in them because i get a lot of fun :)

I've also uploaded all the `.ase` for you to check my terrible layer management on aseprite, how i didn't miss any, you can also find some other old sprites for the higher-res version of the game 

And just so you know it was kinda a pain in the butt to set up the repo and itch.io for some reason
